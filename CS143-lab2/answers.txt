CS 143 Lab 1 Writeup

Design Decisions:
Most design decisions were made for us in lab 1. However, there are a few choices which are notable: 

We chose to implement out readPage() function using a Java RandomAccessFile as it allowed us to seek quickly and easily to an offset.

We had troubles with our initial design of the HeapFileIterator as it would read pages for open, hasNext and next. This caused us to fail the cache tests as we were reading 3x as much as necessary. This led to the implementation where hasNext will read in a page and store it, which can then be used without IO cost for the other calls.

Hash codes were implemented by grabbing the last 16 bits of two integers with bit masks and concatenating them together.  

API changes: none

Missing/incomplete elements: none

Time analysis: 
We estimate that the project amounted to somewhere in the realm of 10-15 hours of work spread out over a period of about a week.

Slip days used: 0. Slip days remaining: 4.
