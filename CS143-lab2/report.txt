Lab 2 Report

Design Decisions:

For eviction, we went with MRU because it was the simplest implementation. When
inserting into the buffer pool, we kept track of the most recently added item.
Then, when the pool is full and we need to evict a page, we have easy access to
the page that should be replaced. We simply call evict on the most recently
added item and replace it with the newly inserted item.

For join, we went with a nested loop, again because it was the simplest
implementation.
